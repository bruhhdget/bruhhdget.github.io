👩🏽‍🎓 I'm a senior at UMBC and will be graduating in Spring 2026 with a B.A. in Geography and Environmental Systems and a G.I.S certificate

💻 Currently, I work as a G.I.S tutor and Lab Proctor, as well as a research assistant within the Geography and Environmental Studies department at UMBC

📍 I originally hail from Gaithersbug, Maryland but now live in (and love living in) Baltimore

Research Interests
======
🏙️ I am fascinated with urban planning and city studies. I hope to work with communities to address the issues of accessibility, public transportation, neighborhood reinvestment, and the reduction of food deserts. 

🍃 Public health, specifically cannabis use among minors, is something I won't shut up about. I'm particularly interested in spatial patterns of risk and access between schools and smoke shops. One project I'm working on involves mapping smoke shop locations in Baltimore, measuring their proximities to schools, and exploring how these patterns tie to the city's longstanding racial and economic inequalities.
